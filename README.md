Organizer printable sheets in A4/3 format (99x210 mm).

## What is it?
This is the icon based organizer where you will rather draw an icon for todo/idea/goal description than write a text. But no strict rules, you can add any words you like to the graphical representation of the item.

## Why is A4/3 format?
To me it appears to be pocket-compatible and still quite large. I like it and just want to share.

## Available sheets
- Empty,
- dotted, dot periods are 1, 2, 4, 5 mm,
- icon based todo lists, icon sizes are 10, 12, 15 mm,
- the info list, how to use the todo list,
- common day schedule planner (kind of day planner from the Franklin planning system),
- week schedule.

## How to print
I use a photo printer to get light, almost invisible lines and dots. You may need to adjust colours to get it perfect on your printer.
